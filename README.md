# Fight-Game

A C remake of *Fight.java* - a game that a good friend of mine and I made
in our freshman year of high school that helped motivate us to learn programming.

## Building
To build, run the following commands
```bash
# open a terminal to the root directory of this project then:
# cd into build
cd build
# run cmake to setup the make file
cmake ..
# run the make file
make
```

The above will build an executable file `build/Fight-Game`. To run the file immeadtely after building, run:
```bash
# assuming you are still in the build dir
./Fight-game
```
