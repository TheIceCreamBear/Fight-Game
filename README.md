# Fight-Game

A C remake of *Fight.java* - a game that a good friend of mine and I made
in our freshman year of high school that helped motivate us to learn programming.

## Building
From the root directory of the repo, first create a `build` directory:
```bash
mkdir build
```
cd into the build, and use the cmake file in the root directory:
```bash
cd build
cmake ..
```
a Makefile should be generated. From here, just run `make`.
```bash
make
```
A Fight-Game executable should be generated. Now you can run it:
```bash
./Fight-Game
```
