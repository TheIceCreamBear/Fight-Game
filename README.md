# Abandonment Notice
As of Friday, October 1, 2021, this project is officially considered abandonded. Multiple factors lead to this decision, most of them being time and effort related, with others being how the project has changed from its initial inception.

For the forseeable future, there will be ***no*** updates or work on this project (asside from the possibly "I'm bored" moment). Should this status change, this notice will be modified to reflect that change.

# Fight-Game
A C remake of *Fight.java* - a text based fighting game that a good friend of mine and I made in our freshman year of high school that helped motivate us to learn programming. This remake also includes some OpenGL rendering and OpenAL audio.

## Building
To build, run the following commands
```bash
# open a terminal to the root directory of this project then:
# cd into build
cd build
# run cmake to setup the make file
cmake ..
# run the make file
make
```

The above will build an executable file `build/Fight-Game`. To run the file immeadtely after building, run:
```bash
# assuming you are still in the build dir
./Fight-game
```
